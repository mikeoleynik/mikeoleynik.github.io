          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>Our interviews with doctors showed that they have a lot of difficulties in their practice. Doctors have to fill in a great amount of medical and administrative documents while consulting their patients.</p>

          <p>Most frequent difficulties:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Low keyboard typing speed:</b> doing paperwork with the help of the keyboard is on average 180 characters a minute.</li>
            <li><b>Time-consuming work with medical and administrative documents:</b> our survey showed that on average nearly 30% of their time doctors spend on filling in the documents (medical cards, journals, tracks of medications).</li>
            <li><b>Diagnosticians don’t have free hands:</b> it is often necessary to fill in the research protocol and examine a patient at the same time.</li>
            <li><b>Emotional burnout:</b> hard work with medical documentation – is the main reason of doctors’ burnout.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>sestra.ai – a voice assistant that records the dialogue between the doctor and the patient and simultaneously fills in medical cards.</p>

          <ul class="list">

            <li>Diagnosticians: frees up their hands for conducting an examination and writing in the medical check list in parallel.</li>
            <li>Doctors: document the dialogue between the doctor and the patient.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This voice assistant will allow to spend 20% less time on administrative tasks:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Save 90 minutes a day;</li>
            <li>A doctor can accept 3-4 more additional people during their working shift;</li>
            <li>1,2 million ₽ a year - additional income for the clinic.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Voice assistant harmonically fits into the ecosystem of the hospital:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Telephony:</b> doctor's appointment 24/7, collection of the anamnesis, confirmation of an appointment;</li>
            <li><b>Multilingualism:</b> conversation between the doctor and a foreign patient will become easier;</li>
            <li><b>Document management automation:</b> automatic filling in of medical cards, logs, etc.;</li>
