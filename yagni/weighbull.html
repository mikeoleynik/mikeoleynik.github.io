          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>Farmers on colonized planets face a unique problem cattle breeding to the different gravity of these planets. Domestic animals tend to float in the air or fly into space. Current solutions, such as tethering animals or catching them with special drones, are not very effective and do not fundamentally solve the problem.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>Universal gravitational device that allows animals to adapt to any planet by creating your own gravitational field. This device, which comes in the form of a horseshoe for terrestrial animals and a bracelet for birds, keeps domestic animals on the surface and prevents them from flying into space. A mobile application accompanies the device, allowing farmers to regulate the level of gravity on each planet, as well as carry out the initial setup and monitoring. The application also offers features like setting a virtual fence, tracking the animal's location, and adjusting the gravity level for individual or groups of animals. This solution not only addresses the problem at hand but also opens up opportunities for livestock farming on planets where it was previously impossible or problematic.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <p>Now let's talk about the possibilities.</p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li>Using the app, you can set any level of gravity, allowing you to adapt your device to any planet;</li>
            <li>If an animal is sick with an unknown disease, you can send it into orbit into space until veterinarians arrive and determine what the animal was sick with in order to make a vaccine. It is also possible to quarantine the animal by raising it a few meters in the sky;</li>
            <li>Built-in gps will always show you where your pet is;</li>
            <li>You can build a virtual fence, and if an animal goes beyond it, the device will nail it to the surface.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Market</h3>
          <p>Our device will make colonization of planets more accessible where animal husbandry has been impossible or problematic. Farm management will reach a new level and revolutionize space animal husbandry. This will trigger a big jump in the development of the agro-industrial market.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Competitors</h3>
          <p>Among our competitors we can single out robot dogs. But practice has shown that they are not very effective. Farmers complain of expensive maintenance. Drones scare cattle. Only Boston Dynamics produces such robots.</p>

          <p>How are we better?</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>We're better because we're cheaper to maintain;</li>
            <li>Horseshoes and bracelets are not felt by animals, they are lightweight and comfortable;</li>
            <li>Animals don't pay attention to them and don't get stressed;</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Business Model</h3>
          <p>So how do we plan to make money from our device?</p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li>Sale of the device. The device will be delivered to the market in two variants: Cattle (includes GPS-tracker and gravity device itself). And Skotina.mini - only gravity device;</li>
            <li>Subscription. It will depend on the number of animals and there is an Enterprise option.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>There are also plans to develop functionality for monitoring the health of livestock, as well as a platform for accessing this information. Such a case will be interesting for business (restaurants before buying meat from a farmer, the public sector would be interested in forecasting the potential quantity of meat and dairy products, as well as insurance companies to study disease outbreaks).</p>
